                    unidirectional airflow in avian lungs</h4>
                <p>  Birds have a remarkable respiratory system in which
                air flows unidirectionally through 'lungs' made up of rigid
                tubes. I will describe our development of a novel
                mathematical model for airflow in avian lungs, and will
                discuss some new insights this model provides.  </p>

                <h4> Simulating plants for the big screen </h4>
                <p> Applied mathematics is used everywhere in the visual
                effects industry. Dynamical simulations of gases, fluids,
		and
                flexible or rigid bodies present big computational
                challenges. In this talk I will focus on the simulation of
                plants and present a solution that involves a fast implicit
                solver for flexible trees.</p>

                <h4> Towards blind source separation with Boltzmann machines</h4>
                <p> The current state-of-the-art in machine learning are
                so-called Deep Nets, which came about from simpler learning
                structures called "restricted Boltzmann machines" (RBMs):
                my talk is about a crucial weakness inherent to RBMs, and
                how it can be overcome.

                <h4> Inductive reasoning and (one of) the foundations of machine learning </h4>
                <p> The failure of Good Old Fashioned AI in the 70s forced
                researchers in artificial intelligence to invent new ways
                of modeling intelligence and learning based on probability
                and optimization -- rather than logic and axioms. I will
                give an overview of the key ideas involved.  </p>

                <p> How to move from a general notion that 'climate change
                is bad' to a quantitative assessment for making optimal
                choices in climate change mitigation? </p>
